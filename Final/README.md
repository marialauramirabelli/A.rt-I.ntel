# Final Project: *(A)rt man(I)festo*  
  
My idea for this final project was to generate an art manifesto/artist statement using neural networks, and then create a series of artworks that follow (or at least be heavily inspired by) what the manifesto/statement dictates. The project therefore addresses the debate regarding the creativity and agency of artificial intelligence, and whether or not AI can [create "true art"](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/can-ai-create-true-art/). So the questions arise: What is "true art"? What defines an artist? What defines meaning, talent, and ownership?  
  
For a previous assignment, I used the Python module [textgenrnn](https://github.com/minimaxir/textgenrnn), built on Keras/Tensorflow, to generate char-rnns and create bodies of text. The first step in generating the art manifesto was then to find existing art manifestos and artists statement to train the algorithm. This process took some time and required me to make certain "creative" decisions as to what I wanted my final manifesto to have. For instance, I found an unexpected amount of Dada manifestos during my research, and made the choice to reject some of them, as I imagined that the word "dada" and other similar ones would otherwise pop up everywhere in the generated text. As another example, I originally included Sir Joshua Reynolds's (1769 - 1790) **Discourses on Art** in my data set, but the text was so long compared to others I added that my generated manifesto read like a non-sensical copy of his (so I got rid of it in the end). The following are some websites and articles that were extremely useful as sources of text (I found more elsewhere online, but these are great compilations):
* [10 game-changing art manifestos](https://www.royalacademy.org.uk/article/ten-game-changing-manifestos)
* [“Artists who don’t paint aren’t artists”: Top Five Artists’ Manifestos Of All Time](http://www.thedoublenegative.co.uk/2015/10/top-five-artists-manifestos-of-all-time/)
* [Manifestos](https://391.org/manifestos/)
